# Web Programming HW6 - React + Axios + Express + Mongoose Practicing (Score Card DB)

## Features

- Follow the style of ref code
- Drop list to choose compare method when querying by score
- Type of query string will be set to number when choosing score
- Show all messages by default and add a "Clear Messages" button
- 2 querying tools, can use separately or with AND, OR (more is easy to implement but too much)
- Didn't add "Next Page" since I think the scrolling style is good enough
- Current design is not suitable for afterward sorting, so I change it to a an option when querying
